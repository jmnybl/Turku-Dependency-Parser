Turku-Dependency-Parser
=======================

This project is an experimental parser development. If you are looking for a ready-to-use, downloadable Finnish dependency parser, you will find it [here](http://turkunlp.github.io/Finnish-dep-parser).


* Cython compilation

For the parser to run fast, you need to have cython installed and you need to compile the fast perceptron training with `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
